# Zoon Project Blog

We are keeping a blog at [https://zoonproject.wordpress.com/](https://zoonproject.wordpress.com/). This is largely for us to keep up to date with each other as to what is going on (most of us are based at different universities.) However, people not directly involved in the development of zoon might also find it interesting to see what progress is being made.
